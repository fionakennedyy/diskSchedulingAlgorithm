FCFS this algorithm entertains requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue

Shortest Seek Time First selects the request with the minimum
seek time from the current head position

SCAN The disk arm starts at one end of the disk, and moves toward the
other end, servicing requests until it gets to the other end of the
disk, where the head movement is reversed and servicing
continues.

C-SCAN The head moves from one end of the disk to the other, servicing
requests as it goes
â€¢ When it reaches the other end, however, it immediately
returns to the beginning of the disk, without servicing any
requests on the return trip

C-LOOK Arm only goes as far as the last request in each direction,
then reverses direction immediately, without first going all
the way to the end of the disk
